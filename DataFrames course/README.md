# Introduction to DataFrames.jl: A Summary and Review

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my sincere appreciation to Prof. dr hab. Bogumił Kamiński, my professor from SLM, for creating this fantastic course on DataFrames.jl. The course structure is well-organized, and the explanations provided through video instructions have been incredibly helpful in understanding the concepts.

I am truly excited about the course content and grateful for Prof. dr hab. Bogumił Kamiński's dedication in simplifying complex topics related to DataFrames.jl. It has been an invaluable learning experience.

DataFrames.jl is a powerful package in Julia that provides a matrix-like data structure for working with tabular data. In this course, we have explored the major functions offered by DataFrames.jl and gained an understanding of its capabilities. Let's summarize the key functions and concepts covered:

## Indexing
Similar to matrices, you can index a data frame using row and column indices. Notably, DataFrames.jl allows you to select columns using strings or Symbols.

## Descriptive Statistics
The `describe` function provides a quick summary of the contents of a data frame, offering insights into the data's structure and distribution.

## Data Manipulation
DataFrames.jl offers several functions for adding rows in-place (`push!`, `append!`), transforming columns (`transform`, `transform!`), aggregating columns (`combine`, `mapcols`, `mapcols!`), and filtering rows (`filter`, `filter!`).

## Grouping
The `groupby` function allows you to create a grouped data frame, enabling operations as if you have created a lookup index to the original data frame.

## Sorting and Joining
DataFrames.jl provides functions for sorting data frames (`sort`, `sort!`) and joining multiple data frames (`innerjoin`, `outerjoin`, `leftjoin`, `rightjoin`, `semijoin`, `antijoin`, `crossjoin`) using SQL-like semantics.

## Iterating and Manipulating Rows/Columns
Functions such as `eachrow` and `eachcol` allow you to iterate over rows and columns of a data frame, providing flexibility in data manipulation.

## Column Operations
You can rename columns (`rename`, `rename!`), retrieve column names (`names`, `propertynames`), obtain the number of rows and columns (`nrow`, `ncol`), flatten nested columns (`flatten`), and handle missing values (`allowmissing`, `allowmissing!`, `disallowmissing`, `disallowmissing!`, `dropmissing`, `dropmissing!`).

## Reshaping Data
DataFrames.jl offers `stack` and `unstack` functions for converting data frames between long and wide representations.

## Related Packages
In addition to DataFrames.jl, we have explored related packages such as FreqTables.jl, Pipe.jl, GLM.jl, CSV.jl, Arrow.jl, PyPlot.jl, and Unitful.jl, which provide additional functionality and integration options.
